csv_module_notes

Sometimes you might have issues with the csv module and files that contain a lot of Unicode, especially if you're using Python 2. If you run into that issue, check out unicodecsv.

https://pypi.python.org/pypi/unicodecsv/0.14.1

For both CSV and JSON files, and others, the amazing tablib library is a great thing to check out

Newline argument with an empty string is used in case 
a newline (\n) inside a quoted section then we want to 
be able to differentiate that from the actual new line marking a new line. 

CSV's are not indexable

Be sure the headers for each column are the first line in the file, if you do not want to have to specify fieldnames in the csv.DictReader arguments.
